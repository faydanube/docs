**Version 0.0.5.1**
### [[特性]]
#### 1. **Local images support!**
`Notice:` it only supports local file storage.
You can copy and paste any pictures to a page, those pictures will be stored in the folder `assets/`.
##### We'll support more kinds of files soon, e.g. pdf, epub, mp3, etc.
#### 2. Added `page` query.
For example: (page "Page Alias"):
{{query (page "Page Alias")}}
### [[Enhancement]]
#### 1. **Much stable Undo && Redo**
`Notice`: It could be slow with page that has many blocks.
There's a bug with block timestamps enabled, so we disabled it temporally.
#### 2. `Ctrl+s` to save and push to GitHub
#### 3. Add `git-auto-push` to settings page, you can disable the auto push and type `Ctrl+s` to push yourself :)
