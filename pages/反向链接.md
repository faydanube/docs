## A backlink is a link from one page to another and contributes to the [[Linked References]] pane at the bottom of the linked page.
## Create a backlink by  surrounding a word or sentence with a pair of square brackets e.g `[[logseq]]`. Typing `[[` will initiate page auto-completion.

#+BEGIN_TIP 
- Clicking a backlink will open the linked page in the main window
- Shift + clicking a backlink will open the linked page in the sidebar
- Opening a backlink to a page which does not currently exist will create a new page with the backlink text as its title
- The [[Unlinked References]] list located below [[Linked References]] on a page displays potential backlinks, files which refer to the page but do not have a relevant backlink present.
